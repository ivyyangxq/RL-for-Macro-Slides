# RL-for-Macro-Slides
Notes on The Application of Reinforcement Learning in Macroeconomics
This is a note for those who are macroeconomists but not familiar with reinforcement learning.
In this set of slides, I will reconcile the concepts used in reinforcement learning with those in recursive macroeconomic models. I skip those parts in Sutton and Barto which are not applicable in the macroeconomic questions.
I also include my thoughts on some reinforcement learning methods and their potential in empirical macroeconomic research.

Please feel free to drop me an email at: ivyyangxueqing@gmail.com
I'm happy to discuss 1. any modifications to this set of slides.
                     2. any intention of collaborating in those potentials I discussed in the slides.
                  

The content will include 7 topics:

1. Topic 1: Basic Concepts. 
2. Topic 2: Frontier Algorithms and Application.
3. Topic 3: Sampling and Adaptive Learning.
4. Topic 4: Multi-agent RL and equilibrium.
5. Topic 5: Shocks in the Environment and the Dynamics Back to New Equilibrium.
6. Topic 6: Sub-optimal Choices and Distortion.
7. Topic 7: RL with other Machine Learning Methods for Simulation.

I will gradually update all of them, and the first 4 topics are expected to be finished by June 2025.
