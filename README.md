# RL-for-Macro-Slides
Notes on The Application of Reinforcement Learning in Macroeconomics
This is a note for those who are macroeconomists but not familiar with reinforcement learning.
In this set of slides, I will reconcile the concepts used in reinforcement learning with those in recursive macroeconomic models. I skip those parts in Sutton and Barto which are not applicable in the macroeconomic questions.
I also include my thoughts on some reinforcement learning methods and their potential in empirical macroeconomic research.

Please feel free to drop me an email at: ivyyangxueqing@gmail.com
I'm happy to discuss 1. any modifications to this set of slides.
                     2. any intention of collaborating in those potentials I discussed in the slides.
